    <h2>==_______==</h2>
    <p>Dear Audience, good afternoon. My name is Abel Schaaf, you may not call me <i>Abe</i>. I am majoring in software engineering, and I am simply hoping for a well paying job. My hobbies include primarily of table top games, such as <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> and asorted card games, and virtual games that are to plentiful to list. I go hear primarily for the affordability, but I have assuredly come to love the poeple and environment it provides. I have been a convert for a bit over half a year now and I am enjoying my decision. I do not have a favorite scripture but I do have a favorite quote that reads as 'It is because we fall that the climb must be our destination.' There is little complexity to me so there is not much to share, but I do look forward to getting to know the rest of the class.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am majoring in software engineer. I enjoy games, card and video, laser engraving, and occasionally enjoy doing art. I am not married but intend to with a wonderful woman I have been dating for over 4 years. I am a covert for about a year and a little under a half now, and I have enjoyed all of it. I do not do much, but I am excited to get past this semester!
